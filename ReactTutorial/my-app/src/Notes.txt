Know everything about the React

1) Props are immutable

2) Functional component - useState Hook
    Class component - this.state

3) <> </> - Fragments (note: can't use key attribute )
    or  
    <React.Fragments> </React.Fragments>

4) Pure Components - Checks (Shallow comparison) the prev props and prev state, if there is no difference in the previous and current props/state then the pure components will not get re-render (whereas the normal/regular component will get re-renders all the time even though the previous value and current are same), if there is a difference then pure component will get re-renders. 

Reason for not re-rendering in pure components: Pure components implements shouldComponentUpdate() lifecycle method by performing a shallow comparison on the props & state.
