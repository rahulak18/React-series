Know everything about the React

1) Props are immutable
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2) Functional component - useState Hook
    Class component - this.state

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3) <> </> - Fragments (note: can't use key attribute )
    or  
    <React.Fragments> </React.Fragments>

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

4) Pure Components - Checks (Shallow comparison) the prev props and prev state, if there is no difference in the previous and current props/state then the pure components will not get re-render (whereas the normal/regular component will get re-renders all the time even though the previous value and current are same), if there is a difference then pure component will get re-renders. 

Reason for not re-rendering in pure components: Pure components implements shouldComponentUpdate() lifecycle method by performing a shallow comparison on the props & state.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

5) The React.memo function is a higher-order component (HOC) in React that is used to optimize the performance of functional components by preventing unnecessary re-renders. It does this by performing a shallow comparison of the component's props. If the props haven't changed, React skips rendering the component and returns the memoized result.

React.memo only prevents re-renders due to prop changes. It does not prevent re-renders caused by state changes within the component.

6) Refs works only on the class components not for the functional components
